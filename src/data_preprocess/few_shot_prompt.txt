WASHINGTON (AP) — The first Women’s March of the Biden administration headed straight for the steps of the Supreme Court on Saturday, part of nationwide protests that drew thousands to Washington to demand continued access to abortion in a year when conservative lawmakers and judges have put it in jeopardy. Demonstrators filled the streets surrounding the court, shouting “My body, my choice” and cheering loudly to the beat of drums. Before heading out on the march, they rallied in a square near the White House, waving signs that said “Mind your own uterus,” “I love someone who had an abortion” and “Abortion is a personal choice, not a legal debate,” among other messages. Some wore T-shirts reading simply “1973,” a reference to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which made abortion legal for generations of American women. Elaine Baijal, a 19-year-old student at American University, said her mother told her of coming to a march for legal abortion with her own mother in the 1970s. “It’s sad that we still have to fight for our right 40 years later. But it’s a tradition I want to continue,” Baijal said of the march. Organizers say the Washington march was among hundreds of abortion-themed protests held around the country Saturday. The demonstrations took place two days before the start of a new term for the Supreme Court that will decide the future of abortion rights in the United States, after appointments of justices by President Donald Trump strengthened conservative control of the high court. “Shame, shame, shame!” marchers chanted while walking past the Trump International Hotel on their way to the Supreme Court. Some booed and waived their fists at the Trump landmark. The day before the march, the Biden administration urged a federal judge to block the nation’s most restrictive abortion law, which has banned most abortions in Texas since early September. It’s one of a series of cases that will give the nation’s divided high court occasion to uphold or overrule Roe v. Wade. The Texas law motivated many of the demonstrators and speakers. “We’re going to keep giving it to Texas,” Marsha Jones of the Afiya Center for Black women’s health care in Dallas, pledged to the Washington crowd. “You can no longer tell us what to do with our bodies!” Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood nationally, told of women forced to drive many hours across state lines — sometimes multiple state lines — to end pregnancies in the weeks since the Texas law went into effect. “The moment is dark ... but that is why we are here,” Johnson told the crowd packed into Freedom Square and surrounding streets. With the upcoming Supreme Court term, “No matter where you are, this fight is at your doorstep right now.” In Springfield, Illinois, several hundred people rallied on the Old State Capitol square. Prominent among them were the Illinois Handmaids, wearing red robes and white bonnets reminiscent of the automatons of Margaret Atwood’s classic tale and carrying signs that said, “Mind Your Own Uterus” and “Mother By Choice.” Brigid Leahy, senior director of public policy for Planned Parenthood of Illinois, said just two days after the Texas restrictions took effect, Planned Parenthood saw the first women from Texas traveling to Illinois for the procedure, with more following since. “They are trying to figure out paying for airfare or gas or a train ticket, they may need hotel and meals. ...,” Leahy said. “They have to figure out time off of work, and they have to figure out child care. This can be a real struggle.” With a sign reading “Not this again” attached to a clothes hangar, Gretchen Snow of Bloomington, Illinois, said, “Women need to be safe and they need to not have to worry about how much money they have to be safe.” On the West Coast, thousands marched through downtown Los Angeles to a rally in front of City Hall. Protesters chanted “Abortion on demand and without apology: only revolution can make women free!” Kayla Selsi said she was carrying the same sign she has held in three past Women’s Marches. It stated, “If only my vagina could shoot bullets, it will be less regulated.” “Unfortunately, I can’t retire this sign,” Selsi said. “Women’s rights are being taken away, and it’s highly affecting women of lower class.” “I feel safer in California as a woman, but Texas is obviously going in one direction and it scares me that other states could go the same way,” she said. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul spoke at rallies in Seneca Falls and then Albany. “I’m sick and tired of having to fight over abortion rights,” she said. “It’s settled law in the nation and you are not taking that right away from us, not now not ever.” At an unrelated event in Maine, Republican Sen. Susan Collins called the Texas law “extreme, inhumane and unconstitutional” and said she’s working to make Roe v. Wade the “law of the land.” She said she’s working with two Democrats and another Republican, and they’re “vetting” the language of their bill. Collins declined to identify her colleagues, but said the legislation will be introduced soon. An opponent of women’s access to abortion called this year’s march theme “macabre.” “What about equal rights for unborn women?” tweeted Jeanne Mancini, president of an anti-abortion group called March for Life. The Women’s March has become a regular event — although interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic — since millions of women turned out in the United States and around the world the day after the January 2017 inauguration of Trump. Trump endorsed punishing women for getting abortions and made appointment of conservative judges a mission of his presidency. With the sun beating down in Washington on Saturday, Ramsay Teviotdale of Arlington, Virginia — who when asked her age said she was “old enough to remember when abortion wasn’t legal” — was one of the few wearing the hand-knitted pink wool caps that distinguished the 2017 Women’s March. Without Trump as a central figure for women of varied political beliefs to rally against, and with the pandemic still going strong, organizers talked of hundreds of thousands of participants nationally Saturday, not the millions of 2017. Teviotdale said this does not lessen the urgency of the moment. “This Texas thing — no way can it stand. It’s the thin edge of the wedge,” she said. Security in the capital was much lighter than for a political rally a few weeks ago in support of Trump supporters jailed in the Jan. 6 insurrection. No fence was placed around the U.S. Capitol, with the Capitol Police chief saying there was nothing to suggest Saturday’s rally would be violent.

The Women’s March returned to Washington D.C. to advocate for abortion rights amid concerns over potential rollbacks by conservative lawmakers and the Supreme Court. Thousands converged near the White House and the Supreme Court, voicing their support for the Roe v. Wade decision with slogans and signs. With the Supreme Court's new term approaching, the future of abortion rights seems uncertain, especially after President Trump's appointments shifted the court's ideological balance. Protests were not limited to D.C.; they occurred nationwide, including in Texas, where the recent restrictive abortion law has had significant impacts. Demonstrators in various cities expressed concerns over the law's effects on women, especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Speakers included activists and politicians like New York Governor Kathy Hochul, who emphasized that abortion rights are settled law. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Susan Collins criticized the Texas law and disclosed her intent to codify Roe v. Wade with bipartisan support. The Women’s March, a movement initially sparked by Trump's election, has seen decreased participation since its inception in 2017, partly due to the pandemic, but attendees like Ramsay Teviotdale stressed the importance of resisting current threats to women's reproductive rights. Security for the march was relaxed compared to previous political events, with no indication of expected violence.

Senior Foreign Affairs Reporter, HuffPost After Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that he wants to redraw Europe’s borders by dismembering Ukraine, Western officials said Monday that they believe Russia is violating international law and are planning a strong response. The European Union and its partners “will react with unity, firmness and with determination in solidarity with Ukraine,” European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen tweeted, accusing Moscow of derailing negotiations between Ukraine’s government in Kiev and pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country. Putin said Monday that the separatist-controlled regions should now be treated as independent of Ukraine. He is widely expected to send Russian forces into the area ― known as the Donbas ― in the coming days and has amassed tens of thousands troops near other parts of Ukraine. In a statement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration will bar Americans from supporting the separatists and sanction people who do. She noted that the U.S. is separately considering major sanctions on Russia if it ramps up its interference in Ukraine, where it has been supporting the insurgency since 2014. A White House official later told reporters the administration would announce additional actions on Tuesday. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said her nation would also unveil new sanctions that day. National security experts worry that intense fighting will soon break out, and Western intelligence suggests Putin will claim that the Ukrainians have initiated it. Alar Karis, the president of Estonia, tweeted, “Moscow is not serious about diplomacy but is looking for casus belli,” referring to a justification for war. “Moscow continues to fuel the conflict in eastern Ukraine by providing financial and military support to the separatists. It is also trying to stage a pretext to invade Ukraine once again,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday. The Donbas conflict has already killed more than 13,000 people. Ukraine is not a U.S. treaty ally, and neither American nor European forces are expected to engage in any fighting with Russians or their partners. But Kiev has received significant Western military support, and President Joe Biden has deployed U.S. forces to neighboring allied countries like Poland and Romania to signal unity against Putin’s bid for greater regional influence. Russia has urged Washington to withdraw military support from those states ― despite their independent status and longstanding membership in the NATO alliance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke with Biden on Monday and tweeted that he is gathering his top national security aides and reaching out to other global leaders, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Following Vladimir Putin's declaration to redraw European borders by dismembering Ukraine, Western officials have accused Russia of violating international law. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged a united and firm response, echoing the sentiment of other Western leaders. Putin recognized separatist regions in eastern Ukraine as independent, anticipating Russian military involvement, as Russia has already massed troops in the area. The U.S. is set to impose sanctions against individuals supporting the separatists and considers broader sanctions against Russia for its ongoing interference in Ukraine. Additional U.S. actions are to be announced, while the UK plans to reveal new sanctions as well. Experts are concerned about imminent, intense conflict, with Russian justifications for war expected to be constructed. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg accused Russia of fueling the conflict and seeking invasion pretexts. Despite the rising tensions, neither American nor European forces are expected to engage directly, although Ukraine has received significant Western military aid. President Joe Biden has stationed U.S. forces in NATO countries like Poland and Romania to counter Putin's regional ambitions, despite Russia's objections. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in communication with global leaders, including Boris Johnson, to coordinate a response.

Overnight Editor, HuffPost President Donald Trump is reportedly telling allies that he may run again in 2024, potentially announcing the move even before President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January. But at least one person who knows him well is deeply skeptical. Mary Trump, the president’s niece, told CNN’s Chris Cuomo that Trump’s talk of running again is just to feed his ego ― but he won’t actually do it for one simple reason. “He will never put himself in a position where he can lose like this again,” she said. In addition, she said, Trump would have to play a secondary role over the coming four years, something he’s not prone to doing. She also speculated that some combination of age, health and the law could catch up with him over the next four years: Will President Trump run again in 2024?\"No\" says his niece, Mary Trump. \"He will never put himself in a position where he can lose like this again.\"https://t.co/euTPxlqAx3 pic.twitter.com/fuEfrQblyw At least one commentator has reached the same conclusion. Paul Waldman wrote in The Washington Post that Trump will likely keep saying he’ll run. But he won’t actually do it. “He can keep telling everyone that he really won the 2020 election and it was stolen from him by fraud (and he will, ad nauseam), but the prospect of yet another loss would be too frightening,” he wrote.

Donald Trump is suggesting to his allies that he might consider a presidential run in 2024, and he might go public with this decision before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. Despite this, Mary Trump, the president's niece, is expressing skepticism about such a move. In a conversation with Chris Cuomo on CNN, Mary Trump posited that her uncle's hints at a 2024 campaign are primarily to bolster his ego, doubting that he would truly expose himself to the possibility of another electoral loss. She believes that Trump is averse to playing a subordinate role in politics for the next four years and that he might also be impeded by advancing age, potential health concerns, or legal challenges. Echoing Mary Trump's sentiments, commentator Paul Waldman from The Washington Post also speculated that Trump's continuation of the narrative that the 2020 election was stolen serves his need to avoid the reality of defeat. Waldman argues that Trump is likely to maintain the facade of a possible run to keep attention on himself, but ultimately, the reality of possibly facing another loss is too intimidating for Trump to actually commit to a future campaign.
